=======MEMORY=======

The memory is an 32-bits array, so the first cell is at 0.
At 0 there is the current instruction adress
At 1 there is the length of the program.
At 2 to 128 max there is the program it-self.
At the of the program or 2 + the program length, there is the program memory.

By default the memory has a size of 128.
[POSSIBLE FEATURE]
