=======INSTRUCTION CODE=======

All of the instruction are stored in the "PROGRAM INSTRUCTION" section which start at 2.
P.S: the first memory cell is at 0.  So 2 is the third cell.

They're codes in 32 bits with 4 octets.
For the next we define that the first octet is the one which is at the rigth and the last at the the leff.
